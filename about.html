    <!-- THE IDEA -->
    <section class="theidea">
        <img class="theidea__image" src="/images/other/logo-hexterity-text.png" alt="Testimonial">
        <p class="theidea__text-secondary">The idea came as an idea from our personal
            need to meet more people from different environment who are
            interested in the same creative fields. When you are a
            living in a big city, networking is one of the most essential parts of your
            career (some people even say that it is the most important
            one) and thereâ€™s a huge lack of real life interactions.<br><br>
            Our goal is to see companies that have been created by groups of
            people that have met on my app, new amazing projects and
            new friends that work together.
